This folder holds local font assets used by the overlay.

Default: `Roboto-Medium.ttf`

Configuration:
- The font file is configured via `clippy.yaml` (assets.fontfile) or defaults.
- `config.py` resolves relative font paths to an absolute path when possible and falls back to a sane default if not found.
