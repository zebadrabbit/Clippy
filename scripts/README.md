# scripts/

This directory contains utility scripts that support development and distribution.

- `health_check.py`: A standalone preflight that verifies binaries (ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp), NVENC availability, Python packages, required folders, and `.env` credentials. It provides quick diagnostics before running Clippy or packaging.
- `test_transitions.py`: Probes each file in `transitions/`, normalizes assets into `cache/_trans` (48 kHz stereo AAC), and can perform an audio-only concat check to detect cross-file issues. Use `--normalize` and `--concat-audio-check`.
- `check_sequencing.py`: Validates the concat sequence policy (intro? → static → clip → static → chance(transition → static) … → outro?).

## Sequencing validator

`check_sequencing.py` expects a concat list file generated by a previous run, typically `cache/comp0` (or `comp1`, …).

Example:

```powershell
# After running a compilation once
python .\scripts\check_sequencing.py --comp .\cache\comp0 --transitions-dir .\transitions
```

If the file doesn’t exist yet, run a small compile first (e.g., `--clips 4 --compilations 1 -y`).

## Setup Wizard

- `setup_wizard.py`: An interactive guided setup that helps you:
  - Enter and save your Twitch Client ID/Secret (writes a `.env`)
  - Choose sensible defaults (clips per compilation, number of compilations, min views)
  - Pick quality preset and tune resolution/fps/audio
  - Configure transitions behavior and audio preferences
  - Set cache/output paths and concurrency
  - Prefer bundled transitions via `CLIPPY_USE_INTERNAL=1` or specify a transitions directory
  - Generates a ready-to-run PowerShell helper `run_clippy.ps1`

Usage (PowerShell):

```powershell
python .\scripts\setup_wizard.py
```

Typical usage:

- From source:
  - `python .\scripts\health_check.py`
- Portable build:
  - Use `Start-HealthCheck.bat` (Windows) or run `HealthCheck` binary.

Notes:
- The checker prefers local `bin/` and `assets/fonts/` paths when running from source, and bundled paths when frozen.
- Coloring is minimal and safe for Windows consoles.
