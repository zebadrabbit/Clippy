# transitions

Put your intro/outro/transition clips here.

Rules: static.mp4 is REQUIRED and is placed between every segment.
You can provide multiple intros/outros/transitions (e.g., intro_2.mp4, transition_05.mp4);
the app randomly picks intros/outros and may insert random transitions between clips.

Examples:
- intro.mp4, intro_2.mp4 (optional, random one chosen)
- static.mp4  (required)
- transition_01.mp4 ... transition_10.mp4 (optional random inserts)
- outro.mp4, outro_2.mp4 (optional, random one chosen)

Files are referenced relative to the cache directory using ffmpeg concat.
